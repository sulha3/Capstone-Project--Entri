Develop a predictive model to identify students at risk of mental health issues. The target variable for the model is the Overall Mental Health Score, which is a composite score calculated using the Depression Score, Anxiety Score, and Stress Level. The model aims to analyze factors like sleep quality, diet quality, and other relevant variables to predict this Overall Mental Health Score with high accuracy.
